REVISION SUMMARY:
Revised some function names to match the purpose of said functions better. Changed some variable
names following the "snake case" preference detailed in the Style Guide for Python Code. Made sure
functions served a singular purpose simply and effectively. Added some comments to make understanding
code easier. Followed the Style Guide as much as possible.
