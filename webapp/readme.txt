STATUS: Clicking on the state buttons will bring the user to the next page, where there is a table listing all the victims of the state the user selected. The user can also click on the states on the map, and it will do the same thing.
On the page with the table, the user can search up a specific victim using the search box. When the user clicks the filter button, the table will be filtered down to the options that he chose, such as age range, incident date range, race, and armed status. 
Clicking the home button will bring the user back to the page with the map. Clicking the home text above the table will also bring the user back to the page with the map. 
The feature currently working is the analyze button. We originally had intended to bring the user to another page with different data visualizations on the state that he chose. However, we did not have time to implement that design feature.
